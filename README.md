PROJECT DETAILS
 * Author   :   Soham Kapur, Koushiki Sinha
 * Year     :   2023
 * Title    :   Circuit Switching using Dynamic Programming
 * Purpose  :   Undergraduate Graded Project
 * Course   :   Computer Networks
 * Desc     :   Simulation of Circuit Switching in Java to find optimal set of paths for multiple data transfers using Dynamic Programming

The result is a set of paths given by the algorithm that would result in the minimum Overall Transmission Time.
Overall Transmission Time here is the time it takes for all the Data Transfers to get completed, or the Longest Time taken by a path.
If a combination of data transfers is not possible due to inevitable intersections, the program prints appropriate warning.
This algorithm can be used as a routing algorithm along with machine learning algorithms to optimize real time maps, and even in fleet management systems.
